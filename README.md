Signal is a real-time American Sign Language to Speech translation program. It uses a point-of-view camera system to detect and translate sign language phrases to computer generated speech in real time. Signal can support multiple sign langauge words, as well as combinations of words and phrases to create sentences. 

A detailed writeup of instructions and resources used to create Signal, as well as how to run Signal on a Raspberry Pi Zero W can be found here:

Signal was created using the Google Tensorflow Object Detection API, as well as pre-trained models from the Google Tensorflow dataset. Transfer learning was also used in the creation of this project.

**Phrases Supported**
The following list contains all sign language phrases that were used to train Signal's dataset. These words can be translated seperately, or as a combination to form a phrase or sentence.

* "Hello"
* "Yes"
* "No"
* "Thank You"
* "I Love You"
* "How?"
* "You"
* "You Are"
* "Are You?"
* "I"
* "Fine"
* "Hungry"
* "Angry"
* "Help"
* "Name"
